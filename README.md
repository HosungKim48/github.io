## About This Project
This portfolio showcases my projects, skills, and experience in the field of data science.
As a business administration student, I'm fascinated by how recent progress in AI enables me to explore this field, even with little prior coding background. I enjoy learning new things through a deep learning lens, where I can experiment with whatever I imagine.
This space serves as both a professional portfolio for recruiters and my personal study space to explore how AI is changing the world in diverse aspects and to broaden my own perspective.

It is built with tensorflow in Python and hosted on GitHub Pages.
